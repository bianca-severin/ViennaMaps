# ViennaMaps
WPF Urban Analysis app with ArcGIS Runtime (.NET)

The Vienna Urban Analysis Tool is designed to support architects and urban planners in the process of city analysis. It provides users with a 2D map and 3D building model of Vienna, as well as various ArcGIS layers on the city's morphology, surrounding uses, green and open space structures, education, health, culture, leisure, and transportation. The tool also visualizes relevant statistics on population density and development, age groups, origin and nationality, education, etc. Users can choose a profile, and the displayed statistics and 2D layers will be adapted to the project type.
